# TASK 002: Event Bus and Messaging Setup

**Stream**: Backend Infrastructure  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Can Run Parallel With**: TASK_001, TASK_003, TASK_004  
**Estimated Duration**: 1 week  
**Team**: 1 Backend Engineer

## Objectives
Implement the event-driven architecture with Kafka/AWS EventBridge.

## Tasks

### 1. Kafka Cluster Setup (Option A: Self-Managed)
```yaml
- [ ] Deploy Kafka using Kubernetes operators
- [ ] Configure Zookeeper ensemble
- [ ] Set up Kafka Connect
- [ ] Configure Schema Registry
- [ ] Set up Kafka UI for monitoring
```

### 2. AWS MSK Setup (Option B: Managed)
```bash
- [ ] Create MSK cluster via Terraform
- [ ] Configure authentication (IAM/SASL)
- [ ] Set up auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Configure backup retention
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch metrics
```

### 3. Event Schema Definition
```protobuf
# Create protobuf/avro schemas
- [ ] Define EmailReceived event
- [ ] Define EmailProcessed event
- [ ] Define EmailValidated event
- [ ] Define WorkflowTriggered event
- [ ] Set up schema evolution strategy
```

### 4. Producer/Consumer Libraries
```go
// Create Go packages
- [ ] Implement Kafka producer wrapper
- [ ] Implement consumer group management
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement dead letter queue handling
- [ ] Add metrics and tracing
```

### 5. Event Bridge Integration
```typescript
// For Lambda functions
- [ ] Create EventBridge rules
- [ ] Set up event patterns
- [ ] Configure Lambda triggers
- [ ] Implement event replay capability
- [ ] Set up event archiving
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can publish 10,000 events/second
- [ ] Consumer lag < 100ms
- [ ] Events are persisted for 7 days
- [ ] Schema registry is operational
- [ ] DLQ handling works correctly

## Output Artifacts
- Kafka cluster configuration
- Event schema definitions
- Producer/Consumer Go packages
- EventBridge rules
- Performance test results
