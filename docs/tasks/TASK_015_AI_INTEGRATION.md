# TASK 015: AI & ML Integration

**Stream**: Feature Development  
**Dependencies**: TASK_006 (API), TASK_004 (Database)  
**Can Run Parallel With**: TASK_013, TASK_014  
**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Team**: 1 ML Engineer + 0.5 Backend Engineer

## Objectives
Integrate AI capabilities for anomaly detection, test generation, and smart analysis.

## Tasks

### 1. Anomaly Detection
```python

- [ ] Implement feature extraction
- [ ] Build prediction pipeline
- [ ] Create feedback loop
- [ ] Deploy model serving
```

### 2. Test Email Generation
```python
# LLM integration
- [ ] OpenAI API integration
- [ ] Prompt engineering
- [ ] Template generation
- [ ] Edge case generation
- [ ] Validation logic
```

### 3. Content Analysis
```python
# NLP features
