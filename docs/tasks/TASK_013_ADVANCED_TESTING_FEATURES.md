# TASK 013: Advanced Testing Features

**Stream**: Feature Development  
**Dependencies**: TASK_005 (SMTP), TASK_006 (API)  
**Can Run Parallel With**: TASK_014, TASK_015  
**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Team**: 1 Backend Engineer + 0.5 Frontend Engineer

## Objectives
Implement advanced email testing features including spam analysis, deliverability, and network simulation.

## Tasks

### 1. Spam Analysis Engine
```go
// SpamAssassin integration
- [ ] Integrate SpamAssassin
- [ ] Build scoring API
- [ ] Create rule management
- [ ] Add custom rules
- [ ] Implement ML scoring
```

### 2. Deliverability Testing
```go
// Email deliverability
- [ ] SPF validation
- [ ] DKIM verification
- [ ] DMARC checking
- [ ] Blacklist checking
- [ ] Content analysis
```

### 3. Network Simulation
```go
// Latency/packet loss
- [ ] TCP proxy implementation
- [ ] Latency injection
- [ ] Packet loss simulation
- [ ] Bandwidth limiting
- [ ] Jitter simulation
```

### 4. Load Testing Mode
```go
// Built-in load testing
- [ ] Email generator
- [ ] Scenario runner
- [ ] Metrics collector
- [ ] Report generator
- [ ] Threshold alerts
```

### 5. Chaos Testing
```go
// Failure injection
- [ ] Random failures
- [ ] Service degradation
- [ ] Memory pressure
- [ ] CPU throttling
- [ ] Network partitions
```

### 6. UI Integration
```typescript
// Testing UI components
- [ ] Spam score display
- [ ] Deliverability report
- [ ] Network sim controls
- [ ] Load test dashboard
- [ ] Chaos test controls
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Spam detection 95% accurate
- [ ] Network sim realistic
- [ ] Load test to 100K/min
- [ ] Chaos tests documented
- [ ] UI fully integrated

## Output Artifacts
- Testing engine code
- UI components
- Documentation
- Performance reports
- Best practices guide
