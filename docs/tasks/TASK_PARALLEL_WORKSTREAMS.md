```

## Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)

### Can Run in Parallel:
```
Stream 1 - SMTP (1 Senior Backend Engineer)
└── TASK_005: Serverless SMTP Implementation

Stream 2 - API (1 Backend Engineer)
└── TASK_006: GraphQL API Development

Stream 3 - Plugin System (1 Senior Backend Engineer)
└── TASK_007: Plugin System Architecture

Stream 4 - Frontend (1 Frontend Engineer + 1 Designer)

└── Start integration with API
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)

### Can Run in Parallel:
```
Stream 1 - Testing Features (1 Backend + 0.5 Frontend)
└── TASK_013: Advanced Testing Features

Stream 2 - Workflows (1 Senior Backend + 1 Frontend)
└── TASK_014: Workflow Engine Development

Stream 3 - AI/ML (1 ML Engineer + 0.5 Backend)
└── TASK_015: AI & ML Integration

Stream 4 - Migration (1 Backend Engineer)
└── TASK_016: Migration Tools
```

## Phase 4: Optimization & Hardening (Week 7)

### Can Run in Parallel:
```
Stream 1 - Performance (1 Senior Backend + 1 DevOps)
└── TASK_017: Performance Optimization

Stream 2 - Security (1 Security Engineer + 0.5 Backend)
└── TASK_018: Security Hardening

Stream 3 - Documentation (1 Technical Writer)
└── TASK_012: Documentation (complete)
```

## Team Allocation Summary

### Minimum Team (7 people):
- 2 Backend Engineers
- 1 Senior Backend Engineer  
- 1 Frontend Engineer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 ML Engineer
- 1 Security Engineer

### Optimal Team (10 people):
- 3 Backend Engineers
- 2 Senior Backend Engineers
- 2 Frontend Engineers
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 ML Engineer
- 1 Security Engineer
- 1 Technical Writer (part-time)

## Dependencies Matrix

| Task | Depends On | Blocks | Can Parallel With |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| TASK_001 | None | TASK_005 | TASK_002-004, 010-012 |
| TASK_002 | None | TASK_006, 013-015 | TASK_001, 003-004, 010-012 |
| TASK_003 | None | TASK_008 | TASK_001-002, 004, 010-012 |
| TASK_004 | None | TASK_006, 009 | TASK_001-003, 010-012 |
| TASK_005 | TASK_001 | TASK_016 | TASK_006-008 |
| TASK_006 | TASK_002, 004 | TASK_013-016 | TASK_005, 007-008 |
| TASK_007 | TASK_002 | None | TASK_005-006, 008 |
| TASK_008 | TASK_003 | None | TASK_005-007 |
| TASK_009 | TASK_004 | None | TASK_010-012 |
| TASK_010 | TASK_001 | None | TASK_009, 011-012 |
| TASK_011 | None | None | TASK_009-010, 012 |
| TASK_012 | None | None | TASK_009-011 |
| TASK_013 | TASK_005, 006 | None | TASK_014-015 |
| TASK_014 | TASK_002, 006 | None | TASK_013, 015 |
| TASK_015 | TASK_004, 006 | None | TASK_013-014 |
| TASK_016 | TASK_005, 006 | None | TASK_017-018 |
| TASK_017 | All features | None | TASK_016, 018 |
| TASK_018 | All features | None | TASK_016-017 |

## Critical Path

The critical path (longest sequence of dependent tasks):
1. TASK_001 (Infrastructure) → 
2. TASK_005 (SMTP) + TASK_004 (Database) →
3. TASK_006 (GraphQL API) →
4. TASK_013/014/015 (Advanced Features) →
5. TASK_017/018 (Optimization & Security)

**Total Duration**: 7 weeks with parallel execution

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Bottlenecks:
1. **TASK_006 (GraphQL API)** - Many features depend on it
   - Mitigation: Start API design early, use mocks for frontend
   
2. **TASK_005 (SMTP)** - Core functionality
   - Mitigation: Build simple version first, enhance iteratively

3. **Integration Points** - Where streams merge
   - Mitigation: Daily standups, clear interfaces defined early

### Recommendations:
1. Start TASK_001-004 immediately in parallel
2. Have API contracts defined by end of Week 1
3. Use feature flags for gradual integration
4. Maintain integration branch for continuous testing
